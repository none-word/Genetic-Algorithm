# Genetic-Algorithm

Hello, it is my genetic algorithm for creating the image from the source image.
\
To get the result, please, do the following steps:
1. Open the program in pycharm or other places for running the python program
2. Add to the directory with the program the source image with the name "image.jpg"
3. The program will ask you to input the number of iterations in the console. I recommend you for testing write 1000. Around 1 minute algorithm will be executing.
4. After that, the resulting image will appear on the screen.
5. Next, you should close the window with the image.
6. If you want to continue, then write the number of extra iterations again.
7. If no, write -1, and the resulting picture will save as "result.jpg". (Attention, there are no "result.jpg" files in the directory until then)


If there are some troubles, please, write me in telegram (@noneword).
